## Concept
Touch the jellies to get gelatin and unlock the new 12 jellies.
When the jellies level up, they make more gelatin.
You can have only one jelly at the beginning. If you want to have more, sell the jellies to get gold and upgrade capacity.

## What I have learned while working on this project is 
- event control between game objects (need more practice and study to design proper and efficient structure)
- how to use slider UI
- how to use state machine and script machine (embed/graph)
